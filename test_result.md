# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   current_focus:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All emojis across the DigiHome website have been replaced with professional Heroicons, creating a more enterprise-appropriate appearance. The Partner Relations section now uses TrendingUpIcon, HandshakeIcon, CpuChipIcon, BriefcaseIcon, ChartBarIcon, and ShieldCheckIcon. The Membership section uses CurrencyDollarIcon, CalendarIcon, ClockIcon, StarIcon, SparklesIcon, HomeIcon, and TargetIcon. The Business Traveler section uses BriefcaseIcon. All icons are properly sized (w-12 h-12) and maintain the existing color theming. Basic accessibility improvements have also been implemented including semantic HTML structure with proper role attributes (banner, main, contentinfo), ARIA landmarks and labels, proper navigation structure with menubar roles, and enhanced screen reader support. The Navigation component now uses header/nav elements, the timeline uses main/section/article structure, and the Footer includes proper contentinfo role. All components follow proper heading hierarchy and include descriptive alt text. Ready for comprehensive testing."
    - agent: "testing"
      message: "Backend testing completed successfully. All API endpoints (GET /api/, POST /api/status, GET /api/status) are working correctly and returning proper responses. The backend is stable and ready to support the frontend Epic 1 implementation. Note: Epic 1 is primarily a frontend task focused on icon replacement and accessibility improvements, so no backend changes were required for this epic. The existing backend APIs are functioning as expected."
